##iloveyou ##
	This a interesting website which can be used for giving pleasantly suprised to your
	girl friend. :D


##Quick to start##
	You can get a quick views of the website by downloading the war package-iloveyou.war, 
	And then copy it to the param baseDir of the http server of tomcat. Lanuching tomcat 
	server.Inputing the web address of "http://localhost:8080/iloveyou" on the browser.The 
	username and password are "iloveyou" and you can login to see the whole website.

##Usage##
	I agree that It's not necessary to repeat what others have did. And I have used many 
	web pages which gether from the internet. They are very pretty and all have a cool 
	design. Many thanks for the creator.

	This is a common Java Web project.You might have some revamps before you use it.
	eg: the name
		罗密欧->your name
		朱丽叶->her name
		
		pictures in album, title, text content, music of the model of goodnight etc.


	You just need use the WebRoot and src to replace appropriate directory. All of the 
	static pages are in the directory of /WebRoot/home, and different model have different
	Working directory.Fellowing is the map of the model and the directory:
	

- 爱你<-->/WebRoot/home/iloveyou
	

- 相册<-->/WebRoot/home/album
	

- 有趣<-->/WebRoot/home/interest


- 烟火<-->/WebRoot/home/fireworks
	

- 晚安<-->/WebRoot/home/goodnight

##Acknowledgements##
	But what I want to empharize is that I'm not good at Web development and especially in
	Front End. Factly, most of my time are concentrated on background development.I do it 
	just for fun. Most web pages of this project are get from internet, and I just put them 
	together.If you have any questions or proposals you can contact me by the email:
	cfreestar@163.com. Thank you for your interesting.
